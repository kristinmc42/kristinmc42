- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kristin. A stage manager for opera, theatre and live events turned front-end web developer.
- ğŸ‘€ I love to read (moslty sci-fi/fantasy), play board games (Blokus, Rummikub, Carcassone), watch too much tv (Ted Lasso, Doctor Who, Outlander) and listen to music (Ed Sheeran, The Bleechers, Jukebox the Ghost, Misterwives)
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently building on my React skills and learning Typescript. Bootstrap is also on my list.
